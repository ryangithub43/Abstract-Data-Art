# Abstract-Data-Art

My project is a program that displays a pattern of images that represent the status of different birds. In the arrays, there are 20 birds with their respective data. 

The program goes through the 2 arrays that I have created, and cycles between them each run. This is what the drawScene(); in my code does for the Theater class. 



# What are you most proud of in this project?

I'm proud of the effort I was able to put into this project. 

# Describe something you would improve or do differently

In my project, I wish I could've figured out the solutions for my problems to make it easier. I was faced with many problems relating to the actual writing because of the amount of time I spent. I would've also asked much more people for help since I was stuck.
